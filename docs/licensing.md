# Licensing

Henge is GPL-2.0-or-later ([LICENSE](../LICENSE)). The shipped binary is a combined
GPL work because usbmuxd and code from Husk are compiled into it, so it cannot go on
the App Store.

idevicerestore's `COPYING` file is LGPL-3.0, while its source headers say LGPL-2.1
or later. If the `COPYING` file governs, the combined binary is GPL-3.0, which
GPL-2.0-or-later allows.

## Not covered

These are Apple's, and none of the licences above apply to them:

- **macOS**, which Henge downloads from Apple when you install it.
- **The boot ROM**, `AVPBooter.vmapple2.bin`. Henge fetches it on the device, from Apple's
  macOS 14.6.1 restore image, when you install. It isn't in this repository or in the app.

An exported Mac is a copy of that Mac, so its folder contains macOS and the ROM, as does
one made by `tools/export_ios.sh`. Those folders are for your own devices, not for sharing.
