# Changelog

This fork collects the fixes from the community forks of [Leviidev/Henge](https://github.com/Leviidev/Henge)
into one build, with a few additions, aimed above all at iPad (tested hardware: iPad Pro M4).
Every change keeps its original author in the git history.

## 0.2.0 (100)

Based on upstream `main` at b744a78.

### Display colour
- macOS no longer looks pale: the half-float display surface is shown as WindowServer wrote it
  instead of being sRGB-encoded a second time. Colour probe for diagnosis (`HV_COLOR_PROBE`).
  — [hungbenjamin402](https://github.com/hungbenjamin402/Henge)
- Colour matching for the iPad's P3 panel (the Mac's frames are tagged sRGB), with live
  *Color matching*, *Linear color conversion* and *Brightness* controls in the session's Details.
  — [sonnx0868](https://github.com/sonnx0868/Henge)

### iPad, Magic Keyboard and trackpad
- Magic Keyboard scrolling calibrated, smoother input, and the device's thermal state in Details.
- Smaller, sharper pointer on iPad, with a size and a sharp-edges setting.
- Video planes copied through the IOSurface's real layout.
  — all three: [sonnx0868](https://github.com/sonnx0868/Henge)
- iPadOS's own hide-keyboard key ends typing, so the Mac takes the full screen again.
  — [gavinnolan](https://github.com/gavinnolan/Henge)
- Screen modes for a Mac on iPad: *Retina* (every pixel of the panel, at 2x), *Performance*
  (about 30% fewer pixels), *Fit this iPad* and *16:9*. Retina is opt-in: it costs a lot of
  emulated GPU work.
  — Retina from [AdamLovattDevOps](https://github.com/AdamLovattDevOps/Henge), Performance from sonnx0868
- 120 Hz ProMotion support, 4 GB default memory on 8 GB iPads, sampling profiler and GPU
  trace/shader dump tools. — [AdamLovattDevOps](https://github.com/AdamLovattDevOps/Henge)

### External display
- A Mac on an external display before iOS 27 too (iOS 17–26), the picture coming back to the
  device when the monitor is unplugged, and unplugging one display no longer freezes the others.
  — [hungbenjamin402](https://github.com/hungbenjamin402/Henge)

### JIT
- At launch, LocalDevVPN is connected first when it is off.
  — [braedonsaunders](https://github.com/braedonsaunders/Henge) (upstream PR #3)
- JIT on cellular: explains the failure and retries instead of blaming LocalDevVPN.
- Personal (free) teams can sign the app: `HENGE_ENTITLEMENTS`.
  — both: [hungbenjamin402](https://github.com/hungbenjamin402/Henge)

### New in this fork
- **Performance settings** (Settings → Performance), applied each time a Mac starts:
  - *Mac refresh rate*: 60 Hz by default. Every frame is emulated and replayed, so 120 Hz
    halves the CPU left to apps; 120 Hz stays available.
  - *Faster disk writes* (on): `F_BARRIERFSYNC` instead of a full `fsync`.
  - *Quicker wake from idle* (off): an idle CPU watches for work for 50 µs before sleeping.
  - *Superblocks (experimental)* (off): translated code runs on past conditional branches.
  - `Documents/henge-env.txt` still overrides everything.
- **Hide the session controls**: a button left of Keyboard hides the bar over the Mac; a
  three-finger tap brings it back (a hint says so the first three times). iPadOS's own
  three-finger undo/copy/paste bar is turned off inside the session so it doesn't interfere.
- Merges kept the Xcode 27 build: the built-in StikJIT helper and the Liquid Glass icon stay
  (the m4 fork's Xcode 16 changes, which remove them, are left out).
- Display name back to *Henge*; version 0.2.0 (100) so sideloading stores treat it as an update.

### Not included
- `HV_GROUPS` (grouped memory accesses): upstream measured it no faster and it fills the JIT
  region sooner.

## Building

As upstream (see README): Xcode 27, `xcodegen`, `meson`, `rustup` with `aarch64-apple-ios`,
and a built [Husk](https://github.com/Leviidev/Husk) at `~/Documents/Coding/Husk`. Only Husk's
`build_ios.sh libffi glib libslirp` and `build_rppairing_ios.sh` are needed for Henge.
