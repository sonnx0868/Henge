/* virtio-snd (virtio 1.2, section 5.14) with one output stream: what
   Virtualization.framework's VZVirtioSoundDeviceConfiguration gives a macOS
   guest, which AppleVirtIOSound drives.

   The guest's PCM goes into a ring here; a host backend (CoreAudio on the Mac)
   pulls it out on its own thread with hv_virtio_snd_pull. A transmit buffer goes
   back to the guest only once its audio has been pulled, which is what paces the
   guest's audio clock. Without a backend the ring drains at the stream's rate by
   the wall clock, so the guest still runs at the right speed. */
