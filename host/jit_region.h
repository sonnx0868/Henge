/* One executable region for translated blocks. Blocks are appended and never
   freed one by one; the whole region is reset when it fills.

   Two shapes. macOS: one MAP_JIT mapping, made writable per thread while code
   is copied in (rw_diff is 0). iOS: an executable mapping a debugger granted
   (StikDebug or the built-in helper) plus a writable alias of the same pages
   made with vm_remap; code is written through base + rw_diff and runs at base.
   Everything outside this file and the final copy in the translator sees only
   the executable addresses. HV_JIT_SPLIT=1 makes the macOS build use the iOS
   shape, to test it. */
